Open *demo.html* to see a list of all the glyphs in your font along with their codes/ligatures.

To use the generated font in desktop programs, you can install the TTF font. In order to copy the character associated with each icon, refer to the text box at the bottom right corner of each glyph in demo.html. The character inside this text box may be invisible; but it can still be copied. See this guide for more info: https://icomoon.io/#docs/local-fonts

You won't need any of the files located under the *demo-files* directory when including the generated font in your own projects.

# ADD/CHANGE ICON IN FONT #

Go to https://icomoon.io/app

You can import *selection.json* back to the IcoMoon app using the *Import Icons* button (or via Main Menu â†’ Manage Projects) to retrieve your icon selection.

Change however necessary, after finishing select "Generate Font" (Bottom right) then click "Download"(Also bottom right)

Extract downloaded files, grab files inside the folder "fonts" and copy then on the folder "assets/fonts"

Rename the files from "icomoon" to "icopmo", changing only "moon" to "pmo".

If there's a new icon you need to set it in the styles.scss file, like this:

.app-icon {
  ...
  &.new-icon:before {
    content: "\<Code New Icon>";
  }
  ...
}
